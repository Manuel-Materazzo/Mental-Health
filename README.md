    <h1>Mental Health Prediction</h1>
</div>

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, yet it is often overlooked or stigmatized. In today's fast-paced and stress-filled world, understanding and addressing mental health issues has become more important than ever.<br>
By promoting a data-driven understanding of mental health, we can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues. Recognizing that factors like job satisfaction, work hours, and financial stress can impact mental health can foster a more supportive and empathetic environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**
The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of depression based on their responses to lifestyle and demographic factors.

- **Identify Key Contributors**: Determine which factors are most significantly associated with depression risk.

- **Predict Depression Risk**: Build a model that can predict whether an individual is at risk of depression, helping in early identification and intervention strategies.

- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer insights that could inform public health policies and individual lifestyle changes to mitigate the risk of depression.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to contribute to the field of mental health research, providing a non-clinical, data-driven approach to understanding and predicting depression risks.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset Description**

The survey targeted both working professionals and students, collecting comprehensive information about their demographic details, academic/work life, lifestyle factors, mental health history, and current mental well-being status.
